1. When discussing instance variables in lecture, we stressed that instance
   variables should be a "weapon of last resort" when communicating data
   around in a program. It's almost always preferable to use parameter passing
   and return values to move data between different parts of the program. For
   each instance variable in your program, explain why you chose to make it an
   instance variable rather than a local variable. (Constants don't count as
   instance variables, so you don't need to describe the constants in your
   program.)
  
A: I made the ball as an instance variable as I needed to change the direction of motion, 
   of the same instance of that ball every time, and I needed to search the collision for 
   the same instance of the ball as well. The paddle needed to be an instance variable as
   I needed the same instance of the paddle to track the mouse, i.e., to change its position 
   every time the mouse position changed. The turns label had to be an instance variable as
   I had to access it throughout the program and it was hard to pass it as a parameter. 
 
   
2. The Breakout game ends either when the user loses three balls or when all
   the bricks are broken. How did you test whether the game would end correctly
   in this second case? Did you make any changes to the code when testing?
   
A: When I wanted to check the Wining condition, I changed the constants NBRICKS_PER_ROW to two and 
   the NBRICK_ROWS to two too. I checked other things like collision and turn counting and 
   the paddle controls while doing this as well.
