Suppose that you want to plot two different types of data in the NameSurfer
program: baby name popularities (as you're already doing), and surname
popularities. Suppose you also have a second data file containing the
popularities of surnames in the United States over time, structured in the same
way as the baby names file. These questions ask you about the changes you would
need to make to your program in order to support this.

1. What changes would you make to the interactors in your program to support
   the two different data sets? Why? Where in the program would you make these
   changes? You don't need to give any actual code here - just describe the
   changes at a high level.
A: I would either include a JCheckbox which specifies the popularity the user wants
   to plot, or a dropdown box where he can select the popularity he wants to plot,
   or I would add two JTextFields to type in, as separating the two types will make
   it easier to program. I would need to make changes in the actionPerformed method
   in the NameSurfer class. 
   
   
   
2. What changes would you make to your program in order to store and retrieve
   information about two different types of data? Where in the program would
   you make these changes? As before, you don't need to give us actual code
   here; high-level descriptions suffice.
   
A: I would need to have two data structures storing the data in the two files, 
   and according to which name popularity is selected, I would retrieve the data
   from the respective file. I would need to make changes in the NameSurferEntry
   class as well as NameSurferDatabase class to store two types of data. I need
   to have two variables storing the data in two different data structures.    
   
   
   
3. What changes, if any, would you make to the NameSurferGraph to differentiate
   between baby names and surnames? As before, you don't need to give us actual
   code here; high-level descriptions suffice.
A: I would make changes according to which TextField is typed in, or which
   CheckBox is selected or which option is selected in the dropdown box. 
   I would have two data structures here as well, and I would call them accordingly.
   One for storing the baby names, and one for storing the surnames.
