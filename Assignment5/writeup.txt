Once you've finished all the coding for this assignment, we'd like you to do a
quick write-up answering some questions about your experience with this
assignment. Edit this file with your answers to the following questions.

1. In Histogram Equalization, the frequency histogram was represented as an
   int[], rather than an ArrayList<Integer>. Explain why it makes more sense
   to use an int[] for the histogram than an ArrayList<Integer>.
A: We already know the size of the histogram, hence we can represent it as an
   array. And it is easier to do calculations on the elements of an array rather
   an ArrayList. Hence it makes more sense to use the histogram as an int[].
   
   
2. In this assignment, you worked with one-dimensional arrays (for histograms
   and sound processing) and two-dimensional arrays (for image processing,
   arrays of sound clips, and the Tone Matrix grid). Give an example of an
   application where you might want to use a three-dimensional array; for
   example, an int[][][]. (To clarify â€“ you're not expected to use three-
   dimensional arrays in this assignment. We'd just like you to think about
   when you might use one).
A: Three-dimensional arrays might be used to create 3D graphics in video-games.
